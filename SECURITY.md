# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
- Send a private report to the maintainers (preferred), or
- If you cannot reach maintainers, open a draft advisory (GitHub Security Advisories).

Include:
- A description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions/commits (if known)
- Any mitigations or suggested fixes
